## My Computer's History
* I got my computer a couple of years ago from my grandfather, and I think it's a great computer. It's RAM storage is relatively large, the ports are useful, and it allows me to browse quickly, making it effective for schoolwork. I like that it's quick to use and useful in many aspects.
* What drains the power of a computer is the amount of tabs you have open; the more tabs you have, the more storage the system has to keep running, thus making it slower.
* Special activities that slows down a computer are large activities like video games that have large files which takes more space, making the computer go slower.
